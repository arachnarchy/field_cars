# field_cars
A web app to aid decision making when booking rental cars for field work, hosted [here](https://arachnarchy.shinyapps.io/field_cars/).

This originated when planning a long desert field work trip. We needed to decide whether to rent a car, or use a personal car under the tight budget restraints of our grant. University departments usually reimburse personal car use by mile (without itemizing gas, depreciation, etc.). Rental cars often offer unlimited miles but are charged by the day. Thus, some trips are more suitable for a personal car, others for a rental. 

I collected these calculations into a web app to hopefully help others spend less time on tedious logistics and more time on SCIENCE!
